# Fetal_health
Predicting Fetal Health Classification:

    In this work, we use machine learning for the prediction of fetal health to prevent child and maternal mortality.

PROJECT CONTENT:

    Import Necessary Libraries

    Data Exploration/ Analysis/ Visualization

    Correlation & Correlation Matrix

    Predictive Modeling

    Confusion Matrix

    Precision and Recall

    Hyperparameters Tuning

Goal:

    The goal of this competition is to predict Fetal Health. We will practice Classification Algorithms to achieve the lowest prediction error.
